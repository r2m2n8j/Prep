******** How to Create immutable class in Java? *************

-> The class must be declared as final so that child classes can't be created.
-> Data members in the class must be declared private
    so that direct access in not allowed.
-> Data members in the class must be declared as final
    so that we can't change the value of it after object creation.
-> A parameterized constructor should initialize all the fields performing a deep copy
    so that data members can't be modified with an object reference.
-> No need for setter method.
-> Deep copy of objects should be performed in the getter methods to return a copy
    rather than returning the actual abject reference.
