******** How to Create immutable class in Java? *************

-> The class must be declared as final so that child classes can't be created.
-> Data members in the class must be declared private
    so that direct access in not allowed.
-> Data members in the class must be declared as final
    so that we can't change the value of it after object creation.
-> A parameterized constructor should initialize all the fields performing a deep copy
    so that data members can't be modified with an object reference.
-> No need for setter method.
-> Deep copy of objects should be performed in the getter methods to return a copy
    rather than returning the actual abject reference.




*********** What is substring *************************

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters that belong to a larger string.

The total possible number of substrings for a string of length n is given by:

    (nâˆ—(n+1))/2

String s = "Ramanuj";
substring = manuj, Ramanuj, anuj, aman, and so on.......

All substring are in contiguous and maintaining order.



************ What is subsequence **************************

A subsequence is a string formed by removing some characters from the original string
while maintaining the relative position of the remaining characters.
A subsequence can be non-contiguous.

For a string of length n
 the total number of possible subsequences are
    (2^n-1)


String s = "Ramanuj"
subsequence = mnj, Rmj, Ramanuj, anuj and so......
Here mnj and Rmj is a non-contiguous But maintaining order.
